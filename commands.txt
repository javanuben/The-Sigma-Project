send file_list {boolean}	Updates the lastModified attribute in the file_list,
				if boolean argument is true: sends a "receive file_list" 
				command to the linked program, and sends the file "file_list.txt"
				If boolean argument is not suplied, it is set to true.

receive file_list		Prepares the program to receive the file_list from another program,
				and saves the file_list at temp/file_list.txt
				If the temp directory does not exist, it will be created.

merge file_list			Merges the current file_list and the received file_list at
				"temp/file_list.txt". If new files are discovered, the user is prompted
				at the console to suply a path to where the file should be stored.
				Note: This command should not be used without first receiving the linked
				program's file_list (if existing, an old (and outdated!) file_list will
				be used).

sync file_list {boolean}	Equivalent to 'synchronize file_list'.
				Synchronizes this program's file_list and the linked program's file_list
				If boolean argument is true or not supplied, a 'set_ip #IP'-command will be sent
				to the linked program.
				(No prerequisites are required (except 'set_ip' on this program).)

send_command [command]		Sends the command to the linked program.

listen [port]			Listens at port for commands.

set_ip [ip]			Links the program to ip. Note: '#IP' can be used (with every command) to
				use the current programs IP-address.

print ip			Prints the ip that the program is linked to.

print file_list			Prints the content of the file_list.

exit				Equivalent to 'quit'.
				Terminates the program, and forces executors (threads) to stop.

load files			Loads the files that should be synchronized (files that has been updated
				since last synchronization) (Needed to run sync files).
				(This will also update the lastModified attribute.)
				If a conflict is discovered, the user is prompted.

send file [id]			Sends the file with the corresponding id to the linked program.

sync files			Equivalent to 'synchronize files'.
				Starts file synchronizing. 
				Important note: Should not be used before 'load files'!

add_file [file path]		Adds the file given at file path to the file_list

remove_file [file ID]		Equivalent to 'rm_file'.
				Removes the file with the given ID from the file_list

generate file_list		Generates an empty file_list

generate other_file_list [?!]	Generates an empty file_list for the other program (usually in temp/)
